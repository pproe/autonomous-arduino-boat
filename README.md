# autonomous-arduino-boat

Autonomous Boat Project for UWA Course Digital Embedded Systems ENSC3020 2019

Uses Arduino Nano, magnetometer compass sensor and ultrasonic distance sensor to guide movement.

# Reflection on outcome and Improvements:
Using a Magnetometer compass caused many issues in directional accuracy of the boat's movement. The use of an accelerometer would have been more appropriate to use in this situation as these measurements are more precisely measured on the scale we were using.
